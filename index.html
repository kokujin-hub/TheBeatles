    <h2>About the beatles: </h2>
    <p><strong>The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. 
        The core lineup of the band comprised John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. 
        They are widely regarded as the most influential band in Western popular music and were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and the recognition of popular music as an art form. 
        Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock 'n' roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways. 
        The band also explored music styles ranging from folk and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, 
        the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.</strongs> </p>
    <p><strong> by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles evolved from Lennon's previous group, the Quarrymen, and 
        built their reputation by playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg, Germany, starting in 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass.
        The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before inviting Starr to 
        join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin developed their recordings, greatly expanding their 
        domestic success after they signed with EMI and achieved their first hit, "Love Me Do", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy 
        dubbed "Beatlemania", the band acquired the nickname "the Fab Four". 
        Epstein, Martin or other members of the band's entourage were sometimes informally referred to as a "fifth Beatle".</strong></p>
    
    <h2>Why I like the band:</h2>
    <p><strong>Obviously! I’ve enjoyed The Beatles’ music since I was a . At that point, I very much enjoyed their simpler, more melodic songs. Nowadays, I prefer their more experimental work. Though I love most of their songs.
        There is something for everyone within The Beatles’ catalogue. Whether you’re into folk, or psychedelia, or hard rock, or vaudeville, or avant-garde, or rock’n’roll, 
        or Mowtown, or even simple pop, there’s going to be at least one song for you. The Beatles were one of (if not the) most diverse bands of all time. Their music spans
        so many genres. No wonder they have so many fans!
        As I wrote in some other posts, I consider The Beatles to be one of the greatest lyrical bands of all time. 
        John, in particular, had such a special way with words. From as early as A Hard Day’s Night, the influence of Bob Dylan prompted John,
        Paul and George to think more about the lyrics. And this resulted in some of the greatest words of all time! Their lyrics touch on nearly 
        everything; from love, to spirituality, to complete nonsense, to made-up characters, to politics, to… We certainly ended up with some beautiful lines!
